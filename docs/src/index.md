# SimplexTableaux

This module demonstrates how to solve linear programs using the Simplex Method.


In particular, it can be used to solve feasible optimization problems of the form 
of the form $\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax = b$ and $x \ge 0$ (standard form) as well as 
$\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax ≥ b$ and $x \ge 0$ (canonical form)

>See the **Tutorial** for a thorough introduction to this module.

This is a demonstration project for illustrating the Simplex Method and for solving small linear programs. 
All arithmetic is exact (using arbitrary precision rational numbers).


This module serves as a supplement to the (currently under construction) textbook
[*Mathematical Optimization: From Knowledge to Wisdom*](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/ers/books/mathematical-optimization/).


### Feedback please

I am hoping this module is useful for those learning the Simplex Method. 
Whether you are a student or an instructor, I would appreciate [your feedback](mailto:ers@jhu.edu).
