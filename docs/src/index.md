# SimplexTableaux

This module can be used to solve linear programming problems using 
the Simplex Method by pivoting tableaux. 

This is an illusration project for solving feasible optimization problems of the form 
$\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax â‰¥ b$ and $x \ge 0$ (canonical form)
and of the form $\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax = b$ and $x \ge 0$ (standard form).


>See the Tutorial for a thorough introduction to this module.

This is a demonstration project for illustrating the Simplex Method and for solving small linear programs. All arithmetic is exact (using arbitrary precision rational numbers).


This module serves as a helpful supplement to 
the (currently under construction) textbook
[*Mathematical Optimization: From Knowledge to Wisdom*](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/ers/books/mathematical-optimization/).
