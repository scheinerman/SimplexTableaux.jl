# SimplexTableaux

This module can be used to show how to solve linear programming problems using 
the simplex method by pivoting tableaux. 

This is an illusration project for solving feasible optimization problems of the form 
$\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax â‰¥ b$ and $x \ge 0$ (canonical form)
and of the form $\min c^T x$ subject to $Ax = b$ and $x \ge 0$ (standard form).
