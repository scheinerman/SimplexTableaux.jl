	dual(T::Tableau)

Create a tableau that is dual to `T`. 

Caveats:
* `T` should have been created from canonical data (not standard). If not, an error is thrown.
* The returned tableau is set up as a minimization problem so the value of the solved LP is negative the desired value. However, the basic feasible vector is correct.
